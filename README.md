# Texas COVID Vaccine Data

Tracking where in Texas vaccines have been distributed. The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) has a [nifty interactive map](https://txdshs.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=91ac7fb5e5fd47e7ada4acfe4a05920a) showing where vaccines have been distributed around the state. This repo tracks the data behind it.
